# Get_Next_Line

### Summary: 

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

### Goals:

1. Build a very convenient function in my collection.

2. Learn Static Variable.

3. Understand File Descriptor.

4. Knowing how to read/write files.

5. Understand memory leak.

### Instruction:

***You can only submit two files: get_next_line.c && get_next_line.h.**

***You can use your libft.**

***All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary.**

***Your project cannot have memory leaks.**

***The libc functions allowed on this project are read, malloc and free.**

***Your function must be prototyped as follow :**

> int get_next_line(const int fd, char **line);

***The return value can be 1, 0 or -1.**

***Static variables are allowed. (Bonus part: Use only one static variable.)**

***Bonus part: To be able to manage multiple file descriptor with your get_next_line.**

### Turn in file:

1. author file

2. get_next_line.c 

3. get_next_line.h 

4. libft/

### Additional files: For test only

1. main.c (but only test to read one file)

2. Makefile

3. README.md
